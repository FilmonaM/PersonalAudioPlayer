## DAY 1

I started this project really early in the morning to try and see if I could squeeze it into the last day and potentially get another projects approved, and I think I've been succesful in the first part. I did literally all of it today from researching and deciding the dev board to CAD-ing the case. This being the 4th project that I've done I have been able to greatly shrink the time it takes me to work on projects that before would take me quite a bit of time.

I still did "waste" a lot of time though because I went through getting almost all the way through with 3 different devboard configurations before landing on this one. And then I also spent some time fumbling through the pcb because I didn't have a footprint at first for the feather adalogger. But here was how my pcb looked on like my 5th schematic iteration, after I found the footprint.

Finding footprints was a big problem for me because I didn't know of websites like snap eda, so I was just looking for libraries that had the exact symbol and footprint for those simple buttons. After that I started searching around for the specific component online.

After the hard part of the schematic was done, I breezed(still took some time though) through the pcb and case.

As for the software, I want to use that opportunity as some time I can work on for Summer of Making, so I will wait until i get the parts until I start working on the actual code.
